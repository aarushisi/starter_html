            <p>Finn is a 7 year old grey cat. I feel like no one really knows cat breeds so I'm just gonna go with grey. He loves doing tricks for treats and his favorite is giving high fives to people. He might as well be a dog as he loves the outdoors and meeting new people. I can only describe him as goofy and chaotic. </p>
            <p>Finn's biggest enemy is his vet. I don't know whether or not it's because his vet is an MSU alum, but he doesn't like him. He actually has to be prescribed a sedative before he goes to the vet office because he'll suddenly act like he was never a house cat for 7 years.</p>

            <p>Sofie is a 15-year-old Beagle mix.  Her favorite spot in the house is the living room couch. 
                She loves to go outside, sometimes too much, leaving us to open the door for her constantly.
                Sofie loves freshly cut grass, she rolls around in it for hours after it gets cut. </P>
            <p>
                Sofie is very old, she joined our family when I was still in a car seat.
                Sofie loves the weekends because she gets her favorite treat, a fried egg. 
                Sofie loves long walks around the lake or on the trail, where she can be let free to 
                run to her hearts content.</p>

            <p>
            Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and playful dogs. Biscuit
            enjoys running outside in circles and then laying down in the grass in the sun for hours.
            He also likes going for occasional swims.
            </p>
            <p>
            As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep in his dog bed and
            watch Netflix with his owners. His favorite treat is apples.
            </p>

            <h2>Cheeto (Chicken)</h2>

            <img src="images/cheeto_cattree.jpg" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower" width="400">

            <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping. 
            
            Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged. 
            </p>

            <p>Lucy is a 17-year-old calico that I’ve had since I was 5, she has pretty much grown up with me my whole life. 
                Even though she’s old she’s still kickin’ it and enjoys running around the house at 4am.</P>
            <p>
                Her favorite foods include anything but her kibble. She enjoys sunbathing and long naps, 
                along with lots of petting. However, she hates getting her stomach rubbed.</p>
